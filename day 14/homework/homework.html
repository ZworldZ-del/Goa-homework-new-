<h1>Devilman Crybaby</h1>
<p><strong>The main reason you should watch Devilman: Crybaby is for the entertainment. There's a lot of violence, a lot of R-rated sexual content, a great soundtrack, and fluid animation. The original Devilman became popular because it was the first manga to push the boundaries so much and become edgy.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Strong performances, a compelling story, and stunning visuals make Mulan worth watching. While it would certainly be better on the big screen, it is still quite enjoyable when you view it at home.</strong></p>

<h1>madagascar</h1>
<p><strong>Madagascar is a 2005 American animated survival comedy film produced by DreamWorks Animation and PDI/DreamWorks, and distributed by DreamWorks Pictures[a]. It was directed by Eric Darnell and Tom McGrath, who co-wrote the script with Mark Burton and Billy Frolick, and stars Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, David Schwimmer and Jada Pinkett Smith as a quartet of animals from the Central Park Zoo who find themselves stranded on the island of Madagascar and must adjust to living in the wild. The film features a musical score by Hans Zimmer. It also features a cover version of "I Like to Move It" by Sacha Baron Cohen, which has since become a recurring theme song throughout the franchise.

Released in theaters on May 27, 2005, Madagascar received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the visuals and charm but criticized the story and humor. It was a success at the box office, grossing $556.6 million on a production budget of $75 million, becoming the sixth highest-grossing film of 2005. The success of Madagascar launched a multimedia franchise, which includes two sequels, a spin-off film, several short films, television series and specials, and a number of video games, theme park attractions and live stage shows.</strong></p>
