They were all banished from their kingdom by the evil Lord Farquaad. Determined to save their home, not to mention his, Shrek cuts a deal with Farquaad and sets out to rescue Princess Fiona to be Farquaad's bride. Rescuing the Princess may be small compared to her deep, dark secret.</h3>

<h1>PYTHON</h1>
<hr>
<h2>PYTHON INFORMATION</h2>
<h3><P>AI Overview
Python is a high-level, interpreted, object-oriented programming language created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. It is known for its clear, readable syntax and emphasis on code readability, which contributes to faster development and easier maintenance.
Key characteristics and features of Python include:
Interpreted Language:
Python code is executed directly by an interpreter, without a separate compilation step. This speeds up the development cycle.
Object-Oriented:
Python fully supports object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, allowing for modular and reusable code through classes and objects.
High-Level:
It handles much of the complexity of low-level details like memory management, making it easier for developers to focus on problem-solving.
Dynamic Typing:
Variable types are determined at runtime, offering flexibility in programming.
Extensive Standard Library:
Python comes with a vast collection of modules and packages that provide pre-built functionalities for a wide range of tasks, from web development to data analysis.
Community-driven and Open Source:
Python has a large and active community that contributes to its development, creates libraries, and provides support.
Common applications of Python include:
Web Development:
Used for server-side development with frameworks like Django and Flask.
Data Science and Machine Learning:
Popular for data analysis, visualization, artificial intelligence, and machine learning with libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and TensorFlow.
Automation and Scripting:
Ideal for automating repetitive tasks, system scripting, and creating workflows.
Software Development:
Used for building desktop applications, software testing, and integrating different systems.
Mathematics and Scientific Computing:
Applied in various scientific and mathematical domains due to its powerful libraries.</P></h3>
