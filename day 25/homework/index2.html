 <h5>AI Overview
CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets, is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language, such as HTML or XML. It is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, working alongside HTML (for structure) and JavaScript (for interactivity). 
CSS defines how elements should be rendered on various media, including screens, paper, and in speech. It controls aspects like:
Layout: Positioning elements, creating columns, and managing spacing.
Typography: Setting fonts, sizes, colors, and text alignment.
Visuals: Applying colors, background images, borders, and shadows.
Responsiveness: Adapting styles for different screen sizes and devices.
Animations and Transitions: Adding dynamic visual effects.
The "Cascading" aspect refers to the rules that determine how styles are applied when multiple style sheets or rules conflict, ensuring a predictable hierarchy of styles.
CSS is not a programming language; rather, it is a declarative language where you define rules that the browser applies to selected elements to achieve the desired visual presentation. These rules consist of selectors (to target specific elements) and declarations (properties and their values).
For example, to change the color of all paragraph elements to blue:
Code
<br>
p { <br>
  color: blue;<br>
}
