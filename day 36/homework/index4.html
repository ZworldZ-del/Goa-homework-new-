    <h2>Alexander-Arnold information</h2>
    <br>
    <p class="wsp">Trent John Alexander-Arnold (born 7 October 1998), sometimes known mononymously as Trent,[4][5] is an English professional footballer who plays as a right-back or midfielder for La Liga club Real Madrid and the England national team. Considered one of the best right-backs in the world, he is known for his range of passing, crossing and assists, as well as his set-piece taking ability.[11] Owing to such capabilities, Alexander-Arnold has also occasionally been deployed as a midfielder for both club and country.[14]

Alexander-Arnold joined Liverpool's academy in 2004 and captained the club across its youth levels. He made his senior debut in 2016, at age 18, and played in back-to-back UEFA Champions League finals in 2018 and 2019, winning the latter, and being named in the Champions League Squad of the Season. These appearances made him the youngest player to start in consecutive finals in the competition. In the same year, he won the UEFA Super Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup. In domestic football, Alexander-Arnold was named the 2019–20 PFA Young Player of the Year and the inaugural Premier League Young Player of the Season, has thrice been named in the PFA Team of the Year, and helped end Liverpool's 30-year league title drought by winning the 2019–20 Premier League. His success in 2020 led to his selection in the FIFA FIFPRO Men's World 11. In the 2021–22 season, he claimed a domestic cup double, winning the EFL Cup and FA Cup. In 2025, after helping Liverpool to their second Premier League title, Alexander-Arnold joined La Liga club Real Madrid.

Alexander-Arnold has also represented England at various youth levels and made his senior debut in 2018. He has since featured at the 2018 FIFA World Cup, where he became only the fourth teenager to start a match for England in the tournament, in the 2018–19 UEFA Nations League, where his nation finished in third place in the inaugural edition of the competition, and the 2022 World Cup.</p>
