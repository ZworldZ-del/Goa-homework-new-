        <h1>DEATH NOTE</h1>
        <h3><p>Death Note is a Japanese manga series written by Tsugumi Ohba and illustrated by Takeshi Obata, which follows Light Yagami, a brilliant but bored high school student who finds a supernatural notebook called the Death Note. The Death Note grants its owner the power to kill anyone by writing their name and picturing their face, an ability he uses to create a crime-free world under the alias Kira. This leads to a cat-and-mouse game with a reclusive genius detective named L, who attempts to uncover Kira's identity and stop his killings. The story explores themes of justice, morality, and the corrupting influence of power, and has been adapted into anime, live-action films, and dramas.</p></h3>
