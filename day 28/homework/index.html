    <hr>
    <p class="p1-1">Fish are cold-blooded, aquatic vertebrates with backbones that breathe underwater using gills and use fins for movement. They live in diverse habitats, from tiny freshwater species to massive saltwater sharks, and possess a range of features including scales for protection and specialized senses. There are over 32,000 known species of fish, which are broadly classified into jawless, cartilaginous, and bony fish. 
You can watch this video to learn about the main characteristics of fish, such as being vertebrates, having gills and fins, and being cold-blooded:

Key Characteristics of Fish
Aquatic Vertebrates: Fish are animals with a backbone (vertebrae) that live their entire lives in water. 
Gills: They breathe by absorbing oxygen from the water using gills, rather than lungs. 
Fins: Fish use fins for locomotion, steering, and stability in the water. 
Cold-Blooded: Most fish are cold-blooded, meaning their internal body temperature matches their environment. 
Scales: Many fish have scales to protect their bodies. 
Diversity and Classification
Species: There are over 32,000 described species of fish, making up a vast group of vertebrates. 
Habitats: Fish are found in nearly all aquatic environments, including freshwater rivers and streams, saltwater oceans, and even extreme environments like thermal springs and deep ocean waters. 
Classification: Fish are categorized into three main groups based on their skeletal structure: 
Jawless Fish: Primitive fish like lampreys. 
Cartilaginous Fish: Sharks and rays with skeletons made of cartilage. 
Bony Fish: The most diverse group, including mackerel, tuna, and many others, with skeletons made of bone. 
Threats to Fish 
Pollution and Climate Change: Water pollution and warming temperatures are significant threats, affecting fish populations and their health.
Overfishing: Excessive fishing contributes to the decline of many fish populations.
