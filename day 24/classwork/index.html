Styling: CSS allows developers to control the visual appearance of HTML elements, including fonts, colors, sizes, spacing, backgrounds, borders, and more.
Layout: It enables the arrangement and positioning of elements on a web page, facilitating the creation of multi-column layouts and responsive designs for different screen sizes.
Separation of Concerns: CSS promotes the separation of content (HTML) from presentation (CSS), making web pages easier to manage, update, and maintain.
Efficiency: By defining styles in a separate stylesheet, changes can be applied across an entire website or multiple pages by modifying a single CSS file, reducing redundancy and improving consistency.
How CSS Works:
CSS rules consist of a selector and a declaration block.
Selectors: target specific HTML elements (e.g., p for paragraphs, .my-class for elements with a specific class, #my-id for elements with a unique ID).
The declaration block contains one or more declarations, each consisting of a property (e.g., color, font-size) and a value (e.g., blue, 16px).
