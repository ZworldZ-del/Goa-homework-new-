    <p>Capybaras are the world's largest rodents, resembling oversized guinea pigs and known for their semi-aquatic lifestyle and gentle nature. They are native to South America, inhabiting grasslands and forests near bodies of water, and are skilled swimmers and divers. These social animals live in groups and are herbivores, primarily feeding on grasses and aquatic plants. </p>
