<h1>Spinosaurs</h1>
<hr>
<h4><p>Spinosaurs were a group of large theropod dinosaurs that lived during the Cretaceous period. They are known for their distinctive sail-like structures on their backs, which were formed by elongated neural spines.
These dinosaurs were primarily carnivorous, with some evidence suggesting they may have also consumed fish. Spinosaurs were among the largest theropods, with some species reaching lengths of over 15 meters (49 feet).
<p>Fossils of spinosaurs have been found in various parts of the world, including Africa, Europe, and Asia. Their unique adaptations and size make them a fascinating subject of study in paleontology.
<p>Spinosaurs are often depicted in popular media, showcasing their impressive size and unique features.</p></h4>

<h2>More Information</h2>
<p>Spinosaurs are believed to have lived in a variety of environments, including coastal regions and river systems. Their adaptations suggest they were well-suited for both land and aquatic habitats.
<p>Research on spinosaurs continues to evolve, with new discoveries shedding light on their behavior, diet, and ecological roles. Ongoing studies aim to better understand their evolutionary history and how they fit into the broader context of dinosaur diversity.</p>
