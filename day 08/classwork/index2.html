    about spinosaurs:
    <p>Spinosaurs were a group of large theropod dinosaurs that lived during the Cretaceous period. They are known for their distinctive sail-like structures on their backs, which were formed by elongated neural spines.
    These dinosaurs were primarily carnivorous, with some evidence suggesting they may have also consumed fish. Spinosaurs were among the largest theropods, with some species reaching lengths of over 15 meters (49 feet).
    <p>Fossils of spinosaurs have been found in various parts of the world</p>
