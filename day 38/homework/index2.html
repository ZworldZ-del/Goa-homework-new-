    <br>
<p class="paragraph1">Khinkali are large, spiced Georgian soup dumplings typically filled with meat (beef/pork, or lamb in mountainous regions) and spices, and are known for the savory broth trapped inside. They originate from the mountainous regions of Georgia and are a national dish, considered a centerpiece of hospitality. To eat them, you hold the dumpling by the dough knob at the top, take a bite to slurp the broth, and then can discard the handle. </p>
